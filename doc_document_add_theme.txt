Win 7 32 bit Powerpoint 2010

Once you have created your slides using ODS PDF and converted them to
a ppt using the free BOXOFT PDF2PPT, you probably want to
add a powerpoint theme. Make sure you used a SAS template that
provides whitespace for the banner and slide number footnote.

If you have a company custom template click on it and
select all the slides, shift first slide then last slide,
Then go to design tab then background slides then apply.
All slides will now have then them behind the SAS foreground
bitmaps.

The following VBA macro will make the SAS bitmaps transparent
and the company theme will appear on each slide.

Note SAS does not provide the ability for a them using
the template. Since SAS titles always appear at the top of a
page you can imbed an image in title1. However I wanted the
company powerpoint theme.

Thanks to the Powerpoint Expert Steve Rindsberg for
the macro below

Sub SetXparency()


Dim oSl As Slide

For Each oSl In ActivePresentation.Slides

    With oSl.Shapes(1)

        With .PictureFormat

            .TransparentBackground = msoTrue

            .TransparencyColor = RGB(255, 255, 255)

        End With

    End With

Next

End Sub
